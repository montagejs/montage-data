/**

 * fulfilled when all the data it expects has been received.
 *
 * Objects receiving data from a stream will use its
 * [data]{@link DataStream#data} property to access that data. Alternatively
 * they can use its [then()]{@link DataStream#then} method to get that data.
 *
 * Objects putting data in a stream will use its
 * [addData()]{@link DataStream#addData} method to add that data and its
 * [dataDone()]{@link DataStream#dataDone} method to indicate that all available
 * data has been added.
 *
 * Objects can either receive data from a stream or add data to it, but not
 * both. Additionally, only one object can ever add data to a particular
 * stream. Typically that object will be a [Service]{@link DataService}.
 *
 * Streams are also [promises]{@linkcode external:Promise} that become fulfilled
 * when all the data they expect to get is first received. These promises will
 * not be fulfilled again if that data subsequently changes for any reason.
